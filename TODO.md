- remove Buffer usage
- remove bignumber.js usage
- remove @multiversx/sdk-core usage (pick whats needed)
- remove conflicting multiversx libs like network providers, signing providers etc
- check what libs can be replaced
- replace Transaction.fromPlainObject and Transaction.toSendable
- probably query arguments and response review is needed, serializers etc.
- move all required types, probably mostly TypedValues required to prepare data payloads, arguments etc.
  - maybe it needs a bigger review and maybe there is a way to simplify passing arguments and building data payloads, more in a custom way instead MVX SDK way
