- move all previous signing providers (wallet connect is left)
  - check what can be done with wallet connect to make it as small as possible
- think about moving xPortal and webview integrations to separate files ????  
- add tests for at least most used utilities, maybe some core tools, check tests in MVX SDKs (more tests can be added later)
- prepare a new API
  - for token operations
  - for smart contracts interactions - the the best would be to pass the arguments as is (always requiring ABI without typed helpers ???)
    - pass ABI as link to a file or as content or both?
- test guardians 
- use Knip to detect unused stuff and do the cleanup
- test on  the testnet
- update README and docs and demos
  - how it is built now
  - what it can't do
