- prepare a new API for token operations
- prepare a new API for smart contracts interactions - the the best would be to pass the arguments as is (always requiring ABI without typed helpers ???)
  - pass ABI as link to a file or as content or both?
- check and handle all the errors for the mobile provider when the provider is not initialized etc.
- add tests for at least most used utilities, maybe some core tools, check tests in MVX SDKs (more tests can be added later)
- test guardians 
- update README and docs and demos
  - how it is built now
  - what it can't do
  - why the mobile provider is so big and what can be done to make it smaller, plus why it isn't so bad because it is a separate file
- check TODOs in code
- use Knip to detect unused stuff (in both packages) and do the cleanup
- test on  the testnet
